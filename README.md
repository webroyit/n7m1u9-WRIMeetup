# WRI Meetup

## Notes
- No need to add `import React from 'react` because it is already added in Next.js
- Next.js includes `<Link>`
- Using `<Link>` from `next/link` uses `href` instead of `to`
- React Hooks should be use directly at the rool level of a component function
- Next.js includes `useRouter` from `next/router` for programmatic navigation
